# landing-page-odin
This is my second project in The Odin Project course after the recipes project. 

I have created a single webpage using HTML and styled it with basic to intermediate CSS properties. The alignment of boxes and the texts were already designed by TOP team. 

This project mainly focuses on Flexbox skills and alignment of boxes around the webpage. I used also nested Flexbox to create the nav bar, and auto margins to split it into two parts.
